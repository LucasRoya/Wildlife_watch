# Wildlife_watch
This project deals with the development of a community Website that allows to share and visualize wildlife sightings. To this end, sightings of wildlife should be registered and visualized on a map. Photo uploads allow to personalize the experience and interlinking species with a knowledge base (e.g. DBpedia or YAGO) enables users to derive additional facts.
